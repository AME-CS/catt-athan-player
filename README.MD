This is a Python script that plays the athan, or Islamic call to prayer, at the appropriate times according to your location and chosen prayer method to a catt supported device.

To use this script, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer and install the required libraries: athan, catt, pytz, and retry. You can do this by running the following command:

```pip install adhan pytz catt retry```

Next, you will need to specify your physical location and desired prayer method by updating the LOCATION and PARAMETERS variables at the top of the script. You can find your latitude and longitude by using a tool such as https://www.latlong.net/. The PARAMETERS variable should be set to one of the available prayer methods, such as ISNA or ASR_STANDARD.

You can also customize the audio files that will be played by updating the URLs in the DEFAULT_ATHAN_URL, FAJR_ATHAN_URL, MORNING_TADHKIR_URL, SURAT_AL_BAQARAH_URL, and EVENING_TADHKIR_URL variables. These variables correspond to the athan, morning tadhkir, Surat Al-Baqarah, and evening tadhkir, respectively.

To run the script, simply execute the following command:

```python athan_player.py```

The script will calculate the times for the next day's prayers and play the athan at the appropriate times.

This script also includes a retry mechanism to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the script. If an error occurs, the script will automatically retry up to 3 times with a 2 second delay between each retry.

I hope you find this script useful in helping you to fulfill your daily salah. May Allah accept our prayers.
